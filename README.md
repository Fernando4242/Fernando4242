I am a computer engineer student studying at the university of texas at dallas. I enjoy learning new technologies from web application to robotics each day. My passion has been leaning towards web technologies and applications, constantly working on a project. At the same time, I understand components and procedures needed to make movable and remote controlled robots. 

The languages I am most experience with is Java, C++, Javascript. I have experiences with languages like C#, python and LabView due to other projects i've worked on.
