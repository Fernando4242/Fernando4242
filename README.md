  Hi there! I'm a Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas, and I have a strong interest in the fields of web applications and robotics. While I enjoy working with both, my passion has been shifting more towards web technologies and applications lately.
  </p>

  <p>
With my extensive knowledge of electrical components, including motors, motor controllers, micro-controllers, sensors, circuits, and other related technologies, I am well-equipped to take on challenging projects in the exciting field of robotics.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I have extensive experience working with several programming languages, including Java, C++, and Javascript. In addition to these languages, I have also worked with other programming languages such as C#, Python, and LabView while working on various projects.
  </p>
