I'm a Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas. working in the fields from web apps to robotics. My passion has been recently leaning toward web technologies and apps. At the same time, I understand the components needed to make autonomous and remote-controlled robots. Including motors, motor controllers, micro-controllers, sensors, and circuits.

The languages I am most familiar with are Java, C++, and Javascript. Furthermore, due to other projects I have worked with languages like C#, python, and LabView.
