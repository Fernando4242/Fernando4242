I'm a Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I enjoy learning new technologies in fields from web apps to robotics. My passion has been leaning toward web technologies and applications, constantly working on a project. At the same time, I understand the components and procedures needed to make movable and remote-controlled robots. Including motors, motor controllers, micro-controllers, and digital circuits.

The languages I am most familiar with are Java, C++, and Javascript. I have worked with languages like C#, python, and LabView due to other projects.
