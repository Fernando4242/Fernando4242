I'm a Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas, I enjoy working in the fields of web apps and robotics. My passion has been recently leaning toward web technologies and apps. At the same time, I understand the components needed to make simple autonomous and remote-controlled robots. Including motors, motor controllers, micro-controllers, sensors, and circuits.

The languages I am most familiar with are Java, C++, and Javascript. Furthermore, I have worked with languages like C#, python, and LabView due to other projects.
